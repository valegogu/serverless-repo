## About Me
I'm Valeria! I'm a Computer Science major with a Chinese minor. I'm very interested in data science, 
machine learning, and natural language processing. I have a little bit of experience with Github 
through a quantum computing open source project I worked on with AWS, but I want to get more 
comfortable with the process. In my free time I like to swim, draw, and play guitar.
